# Modern Android Media Browser
A contrived sample app

## Purpose
Showcase my modern Android development skills with a sample app, to aid in landing my next job.

I was laid off as part of a 10% staff reduction in March. After a 2 month sabbatical I'm now rested and looking for my next Android adventure.
This project aims to keep me busy and my skills fresh until I land my next job. UI/UX polish is taking a backseat to engineering best practices to 
begin with, but I look forward to improving that as well.

I welcome any and all feedback, and I'm intentionally publishing this with some glaring warts, to serve as motivation to clean them up before
too many prospective employers take a look and throw my application in the dust bin. :sunglasses:
