# Purpose
Showcase modern Android development skills with a sample app.

I was laid off as part of a 10% staff reduction in March. After a 2 month sabbatical I'm rested and looking for my next Android adventure.
This project aims to keep me busy and my skills fresh until I land my next job. UI/UX polish is taking a backseat to engineering best practices to 
begin with, but I look forward to improving that as well.

I welcome any and all feedback, and I'm intentionally publishing this with some initial warts, to server as motivation to clean them up before
too many prospective employers take a look and need to hold there nose. :sunglasses:
